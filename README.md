# KingOfTheHill
Inspired by Mr. Griffith's BBS from 1983 in Tampa Florida - KING OF THE HILL

Login every 'x' hours and generate more fighters. When you think you have enough, charge the hill. If you win, you are the King of the hill until someone overtakes your fighters. We will be expanding this to have some original variations to what we remember the game play was like. This is just another tutorial on Modern Pascal, and building blocks of building interactive games.

# Versions
We are going to upload each revision in the evolution of reproducing the functionality of an extremely popular, yet simple, BBS door game.

v0.1 - Does a genertic Intro, gets players name, and loops reading the keyboard for 2 commands (ESCAPE) to quit and (SPACE BAR) to generate fighters. No accumlation. No charge the hill... those pieces are in v0.2.

v0.2 - Stores the current players information and last move timestamp. Implements the logic to display current number of fighters, save newly generated team, more of an introduction screen and adds a little more communications to the game player. Easpe to Quit, Space Bar to Generate more Fighters (once every 24 hours), place holder for "C"harge the hill which will be in v0.3
